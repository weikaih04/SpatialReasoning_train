## 👀 About ThinkMorph

Multimodal reasoning demands synergistic coordination of language and vision. However, determining what constitutes meaningful interleaved reasoning is non-trivial, and current approaches lack a generalizable recipe.
We present **ThinkMorph**, a unified model that enables such generalization through a principled approach: treating text and images as complementary modalities that mutually advance reasoning.

</p>
Guided by this principle, we identify tasks requiring concrete, verifiable visual engagement and design a high-quality data pipeline that trains models to generate interleaved images and text as progressive reasoning traces.

</p>

ThinkMorph delivers substantial gains on **vision-centric** tasks, achieving an average improvement of 34.74% over the base model while consistently surpassing text-only and image-only modes.
By fine-tuning with **merely ~24K** samples, it achieves out-of-domain performance that rivals or even surpasses leading large-scale, proprietary VLMs.

Intriguingly, ThinkMorph unlocks emergent properties that represent a *hallmark of multimodal intelligence*: the elicitation of unseen visual manipulation skills, the self-adaptive switching between reasoning modes according to task complexity, and better test-time scaling via diversified thoughts.

These findings suggest promising directions for future work to characterize the emergent capabilities of unified models for multimodal reasoning.

## 🔥 Quick Start

1️⃣  Set up environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThinkMorph/ThinkMorph.git
cd ThinkMorph
conda create -n thinkmorph python=3.10 -y
conda activate thinkmorph
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2️⃣  Download checkpoint
```bash
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
hf download ThinkMorph/ThinkMorph
```

3️⃣ Use `inference.ipynb` to play with ThinkMorph!

## 🔥 Train & Eval

### Training Data prepration

We opensource our training data mentioned in our paper containing four tasks: **Jigsaw Assembly**, **Spatial Navigation**, **Visual Search** , and **Chart Refocus**. Here we show typical examples of four tasks. Training data can be downloaded from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ThinkMorph).



1. **Download the training dataset**

   ```python
    from datasets import load_dataset

    # Jigsaw Assembly
    dataset = load_dataset("ThinkMorph/Jigsaw_Assembly", split="train")

    # Spatial Navigation
    dataset = load_dataset("ThinkMorph/Spatial_Navigation", split="train")

    # Visual Search
    dataset = load_dataset("ThinkMorph/Visual_Search", split="train")

    # Chart Refocus
    dataset = load_dataset("ThinkMorph/Chart_Refocus", split="train")
    ```

2. Convert the downloaded dataset into a data format suitable for model training. For details on the Bagel officially supported data formats, see in [Train](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Bagel/blob/main/TRAIN.md). Based on Bagel's implementation, we modify the training code to support our interleaved data format, and an easy-to-understand example of a parquet file is shown below:

```python
{
    "image_list": [problem_image_0, reasoning_image_0],
    "instruction_list": [question],
    "output_text_list": [f"<think>{resoning_thought_0}</think><image_start>",f"<image_end><think>{resoning_thought_1}</think><answer>{answer}</answer>"],
}
```

3. Edit **`data/dataset_info.py`** with your own data path.

4. Edit **`configs/example.yaml`**. Additionally, we provide example configuration files corresponding to the different training settings in `data/configs`.

### Eval

All evaluations are conducted using the [`VLMEvalKit`](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) framework for consistency and reproducibility. The inference process can be referred to [infernece.ipynb](inference.ipynb)
